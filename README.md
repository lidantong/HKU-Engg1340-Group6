HKU-Engg1340-Group6
-------------------
Group project for HKU Engg1340 programming course.

Problem Statement:flashlight:
-----------------

This C++ programme is mainly aimming at helping grocerry stores and the like to manage the waiting list of customers. To obtain **the maximum profit**, there are a few factors needing to be considered:

- The number of cashiers
- The current waiting list and the customers in it
- The prices of different goods
- The time to be occupied by each customer

As the project is still in stage Beta, we here make a few assumptions to model the reality:

- The more the grocery one customer has, the time it takes to spend at the register will be longer.
- If the waiting time is longer than 15 minutes, the customers will leave without buying anything.
- Opening a new register costs an activation fee.
- We know exactly what a customer is gonna purchase.
- The number of cashiers are limitless.
- The grocerry store has the power to sort customers to maximum its profit.
