HKU-Engg1340-Group6
-------------------
Group project for **HKU Engg1340** programming course.

Problem Statement:flashlight:
-----------------

This C++ programme is mainly aimming at helping **grocerry stores** and the like to manage the waiting list of customers. To obtain **the maximum profit**, there are a few factors needing to be considered:

- The number of cashiers
- The current waiting list and the customers in it
- The prices of different goods
- The time to be occupied by each customer

As the project is still in stage **Beta**, we here make a few **assumptions** to model the reality:

- The more the grocery one customer has, the time it takes to spend at the register will be longer.
- If the waiting time is longer than 15 minutes, the customers will leave without buying anything.
- Opening a new register costs an activation fee.
- We know exactly what a customer is gonna purchase.
- The number of cashiers are limitless.
- The grocerry store has the power to sort customers to maximum its profit.

Feature Support:gift:
---------------

The project is capable of the following features: (to be continued...)

1. Being able to read from grocery file including information such as grocery and its price.
2. Being able to randomly generate a customer (at least 50 customers for testing) with random grocery.
3. Being able to calculate the processing time of one customer spent in the cashier.
4. The system is able to sort customers into cashier.
5. It provide an express line for grocery amount under 5.
6. Profit should be positive at the end of testing.
