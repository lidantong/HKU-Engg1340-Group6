Problem Statement:flashlight:
-----------------

This C++ project is aiming at helping **grocery stores** and the like to manage the waiting list of customers. 

In reality, the management of cashiers is crucial to the total revenue and customers' experience. Though the customers are supposed to wait in line for check-out, the number of cashiers and how to arrange the queue also count for total efficiency.  If there are too few cashiers, customers may get impatient and leave without finishing their purchase, while too many cashiers are a waste of human resource. Thus, an assisting program in function of arranging the cashier is useful and necessary for a grocery store.

This project applies to a specific assumpted situation: Customers each with respective numbers and types of groceries and the same maximum waiting time are waiting in order. The total time of a single check-out is only determined by the number of items. The program collects data of groceries, including number and price of each grocery, the expense of a cashier, and customers, including their names, number, and name of their purchase, in a given format for manual input or file input. Then, it processes the optimized number of cashiers and the allocation plan as well as the total revenue and displays on the screen or saves the file.

Feature Support:gift:
---------------

The project is capable of the following features: (to be continued)

1. To read from grocery file including information such as goods and their prices. (valid data provided)
2. To randomly generate a customer with certain grocery goods. (for test)
3. To read customers' information (the input order implies the order in the queue) and maximum waiting time from manual input or file input. (valid data provided)
4. To get a maximum number of cashiers from standard input. (fewer than the default number: 50)
5. To calculate the optimized plan and revenue of different numbers of cashier open within the given maximum waiting time
6. To output the detailed plan, including numbers of the cashier, total with maximum revenue to the screen for the client's reference.
7. To give the client an option to save the file.
