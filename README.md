Problem Statement:flashlight:
-----------------

This C++ project is aiming at helping **grocery stores** and the like to manage the waiting list of customers. 

In reality, the management of cashiers is crucial to the total revenue and customers' experience. Though the customers are supposed to wait in line for check-out, the number of cashiers and how to arrange the queue also count for total efficiency.  If there are too few cashiers, customers may get impatient and leave without finishing their purchase, while too many cashiers are a waste of human resource. Thus, an assisting program in function of arranging the cashier is useful and necessary for a grocery store.

This project applies to a specific assumpted situation: Customers each with respective numbers and types of groceries are waiting in order. The total time of a single check-out is only determined by the number of items. The program collects data of the expanse of a cashier and customers, including their names, number and price of each grocery, in a given format for manual input or file input. Then, it processes the optimized allocation plan as well as the total revenue and displays on the screen or saves the file.

Feature Support:gift:
---------------

The project is capable of the following features: (to be continued...)

1. To read from grocery file including information such as goods and their prices.(default: data validation)
2. To randomly generate a customer with certain grocery goods.(for test)
3. To get one piece of customers' information from manual input. (default: data validation)
4. To generate a queue where customers are in a certain order. (one cannot cut line)
5. To calculate the processing time of each customer at the cashiers.
6. To get a maximum number of cashiers from standard input. (fewer than the default number: 50)
7. To get a command from the standard input about whether to set an express line for customers with goods fewer than a certain number(another input).
8. To optimise the number of cashiers for maximum profit and display the detailed distribution strategy.
