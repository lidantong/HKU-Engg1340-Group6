Problem Statement:flashlight:
-----------------

This C++ project is aiming at helping **grocery stores** and the like to manage the waiting list of customers. 

**In reality**, cashiers in grocery stores are usually crowded with people carrying various types and amounts of groceries. We assume that:
- The store holds **no cashier** at first and each new one will cost a certain amount of money. 
- Each customer carries different items waiting to checkout with equal "patience" -- he or she is willing to wait for a certain amount of time, or will just leave without any purchase. 
- Groceries have different prices and the total number of items determines the time of a single checkout procedure. 
- The store has the right to adjust the order of the waiting line.

The goal of our project is to provide **optimized plans** of queuing to obtain a maximum profit of a given grocery store as well as generate grocery stores with specific or random parameters.

Feature Support:gift:
---------------

The project is capable of the following features: (to be continued...)

1. To read from grocery file including information such as goods and their prices.
2. To randomly generate a customer (at least 50 customers for testing) with random grocery.
3. To calculate the processing time of one customer spent in the cashier.
4. To optimize the queue for maximum profit and display the plan.
5. To create express line for customers with fewer items.
