Problem Statement:flashlight:
-----------------

This C++ project is aiming at helping **grocery stores** and the like to manage the waiting list of customers. 

In reality, cashiers in grocery stores are usually crowded with people carrying various types and amounts of groceries. We assume that the store holds **no cashier** in initial and each new one will cost a certain amount of money. Each customer carries different items waiting for checkout with equal "patience" -- he or she is willing to wait for a certain amount of time, or he or she will merely leave without any purchase. Groceries have different prices while the total number of items determines the time of a single checkout procedure. 

The goal of our project is to provide optimized plans of queuing to obtain a maximum profit of a given grocery store as well as generate grocery stores with specific or random parameters.

Feature Support:gift:
---------------

The project is capable of the following features: (to be continued...)

1. To read from grocery file including information such as grocery and its price.
2. To randomly generate a customer (at least 50 customers for testing) with random grocery.
3. To calculate the processing time of one customer spent in the cashier.
4. To optimize the queue for maximum profit and display the plan.
5. To arrange express line for customers with fewer items.
